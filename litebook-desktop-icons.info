Hello!

Desktop icons are now enabled for Pantheon by using Nautilus as a backend.  This
info is also saved as /etc/litebook-scripts/info/litebook-desktop-icons.info.

*** STARTING AND RESTARTING ***
The process that enables desktop icons is nautilus -n --force-desktop &.  If you 
see this process in ps, top, htop, etc, please leave it running or desktop icons 
will break.

If the nautilus -n --force-desktop & process ends unexpectedly, simply execute the 
script litebook-desktop-icons-start.sh in /etc/litebook-scripts/scripts.  This script 
is also automatically set to execute on boot.

*** DEFAULT DESKTOP ICONS ***
To change the default desktop icons used (home, trash, etc), you need to use 
dconf Editor and navigate to org > gnome > nautilus > desktop, you can also use 
gsettings if you prefer the cli. 

*** DESKTOP FONT COLOR ***
Font color is handled by creating the file gtk.css in ~/.config/gtk-3.0.  Add the
following css to this file (only change the color hex code):

	.nautilus-desktop.nautilus-canvas-item {color: <your color hex code> ;text-shadow: 1 1 alpha (@fg_color, 0.8);}

After the change, execute the script litebook-desktop-icons-start.sh in 
/etc/litebook-scripts/scripts, and your new font color will take effect (Sorry for 
the hassle.  I also wish it was easier).  

*** NAUTILUS APP MENU ENTRY ***
This service sets Nautilus to be hidden from your applications menu.  If you want 
it to be visible, edit the nautilus.desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications 
to say NoDisplay=false instead of NoDisplay=true.  Programs such as menulibre 
make this very easy, if you want to use a dedicated menu editor.

Enjoy!
